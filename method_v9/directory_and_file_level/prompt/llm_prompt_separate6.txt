Generally this sounds good. What's the proposed API? An error wrapper type for certificate validation failure that includes the peer certificates? Should it also be raise on a failed VerifyPeerCertificates or VerifyConnection?

How is this different from #48151 and why does that issue say "it's done wrong for client certificates"? We could generally use a more detailed "what did you do" / "what did you expect" / "what did you see".

_An error wrapper type for certificate validation failure that includes the peer certificates?_ 
Yes, because, this would help debug what certs were presented while trying to make the connection.

_Should it also be raise on a failed VerifyPeerCertificates or VerifyConnection?_ 
Not sure about this, but I believe, if VerifyPeerCertificate is set, its upto up to parse and verify the certificate which I guess, we could anyways do in case of an error. So, maybe not required. 

_How is this different from #48151 and why does that issue say "it's done wrong for client certificates"?_ 
So, I mentioned that because, looking at the logs I couldn't find the cert in the err.Error() where as the string preceeding that called out "failed to verify client certificate". I hoped the returned error would contain the certificate that was presented. 


--- Comment #7 by rsc ---
It sounds like the answer is to suggest a new error wrapper type that will hold the certificates and be returned on validation failure?

Alternately, is it possible to get this info using a custom VerifyPeerCertificates? Or is there no way to invoke the usual code in that case?

You can do it with VerifyConnection/VerifyPeerCertificates, although you have to maintain some state at a higher lexical scope and it's kind of hard to associate a VerifyConnection/VerifyPeerCertificates invocation with an error returned by Handshake.

Assuming it's possible to unwrap the Handshake return value to get an error as returned by VerifyConnection/VerifyPeerCertificates, one can implement the certificate check there and return a wrapped error.

Still, setting InsecureSkipVerify to bypass the normal checks, then reimplementing them just to return an error wrapper to get access to the certificates is quite burdensome.

I wouldn't be opposed to a new error wrapper with an `UnverifiedCertificates` field, that can be accessed with errors.As.

--- Comment #10 by rsc ---
It sounds like we need an API, then, specifically a name for the error.

```
type UnverifiedCertificatesError struct {
    UnverifiedCertificates []*x509.Certificate
}

func (e *UnverifiedCertificatesError) Error() string { ... }
```

Is this the API?



--- Comment #11 by FiloSottile ---
Maybe the error name is `CertificateVerificationError`?

--- Comment #12 by rsc ---
OK, so it sounds like:

```
type CertificateVerificationError struct {
    UnverifiedCertificates []*x509.Certificate
}

func (e * CertificateVerificationError) Error() string { ... }
```

Does anyone object to that API?


--- Comment #13 by rsc ---
Does anyone object to the API in the preceding comment?


--- Comment #14 by rsc ---

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely accept](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-accept)**.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** 
You can ONLY select files that are explicitly shown in the repository structure above. 
If the proposal discusses topics not covered by the files in this structure, return an empty list.

**Step-by-step process:**
1. Read the proposal title and content.  
2. Scan the repository structure above for matching file paths.  
3. Include only those files you actually see listed.  
4. If none match, return an empty list (`[]`).

Please output your answer in the following format:
Return a JSON object with the following format.
The response MUST:
- Be a valid JSON block.
- Contain a key `found_files` with a list of file paths.
- Output ONLY the raw JSON object. Do NOT include any markdown formatting (no ```json or ```).
- Do NOT add any explanations or additional text.
- If you are unsure which files apply, return an empty list.

Example of correct output when files are found:
{
  "found_files": [
    "src/crypto/dsa/dsa.go",
    "src/net/http/server.go"
  ]
}

Example of correct output when files are not found:
{
  "found_files": []
}
