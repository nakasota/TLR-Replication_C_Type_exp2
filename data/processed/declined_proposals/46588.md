=== Fetching Proposal: Poor feasibility ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46588

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: text/template: allow multiple actions within `{{}}`

==== [Issue Body] ====
### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?

1.16.4

### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?

Yes

### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?

GOARCH="amd64"
GOOS="darwin"

### What did you do?

The desire is to be able to place multiple commands in a Go text template. We already have newlines supported ( https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29770 ). If we get multiple commands using any separator, we can simplify templates with multiple mustaches one after the other.

An example using Hugo (with a semi-colon as a separator, can be anything):

```
{{
      with site.Title;
          printf "%s" (. | humanize);
     else;
          printf "No title";
     end;
}}
```

equivalent to:

```
{{with site.Title}}
    {{printf "%s" (. | humanize)}}
{{else}}
  {{printf "No title"}}
{{end}}
```

It's unclear why we would take on the added complexity here when there is already a way to write that with more  {{ }}.

This proposal has been added to the [active column](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#active) of the proposals project
and will now be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

Why not use `{{- else -}}` to make the whitespace work with the existing mechanism? 

For the specific case of a simple if expression, Hugo has `cond`, which works like 

```
{{ cond site.Title (site.Title | humanize) "No title" }}
```

That may solve your usecase, but note that it eagerly evaluates both alternatives.

I agree that the implementation and specification cost is large for a small benefit. It is not a goal of the template language to be as convenient as possible, but rather just to provide a safe link between macro expansion and Go values.

Here are a few examples of complex logic encapsulated in templates that might help this discussion:

- https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/shortcodes/instagram.html
- https://www.sidorenko.io/post/2017/07/nice-tagcloud-with-hugo/
- https://github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-debugprint/blob/master/layouts/partials/debugprint.html

Most of the [embedded templates](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/) in Hugo are having a huge amount of template code where it is harder to read with the mustaches around them.

--- Comment #7 by earthboundkid ---
I have written [a lot of frontend logic in my Hugo templates](https://github.com/spotlightpa/poor-richard/tree/master/layouts/partials/helper) myself. I don't find the mustaches to be a big deal, particularly for HTML where whitespace is not significant and gets minimized away. Before you could reassign variables (!), it was a pain to have to use a Hugo scratch for logic, but now that you can, it's basically just a simple dynamic language for processing frontend tags from my point of view, like PHP but more internally consistent.

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely decline](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-decline)**.

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
