=== Fetching Proposal: Deprecated proposals ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42950

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: os/exec: use LookPathAbs by default 

==== [Issue Body] ====
exec.Command("ls") calls LookPath to find an "ls" executable to run.
If users are on Windows, or if they are on Unix with "." in their $PATH ahead of /bin, it will run ./ls when that exists.
That's almost never what you really want - see #38736 and related issues.

If we adopt #42420, perhaps we should also make exec.Command default to using LookPathAbs instead of LookPath (unless the command is explicitly "./ls" (`.\ls` on Windows)).

 

==== [Comments] ====

--- Comment #1 by rsc ---
We now have three active proposals related to dot in path lookup:

 - #38736, which removes the implicit dot lookup from LookPath on Windows
 - #42420, to add LookPathAbs that doesn't return relative results.
 - #42950, to make exec.Command use LookPathAbs by default (assuming it is added)

Please try to keep comments on these limited to the specific issue they track. Thanks.

Retracting in favor of #43724.

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
