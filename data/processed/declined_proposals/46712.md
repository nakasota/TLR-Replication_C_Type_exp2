=== Fetching Proposal: Duplication ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46712

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: cmd/go: add "go test -compile" option to just compile tests, not link or run them

==== [Issue Body] ====
Propose we add a `-compile` flag to `go test` that just compiles the tests without linking or running them. 

Right now we have to do something like go test -run=xxx, which is not very discoverable, and takes the time to link and run the test executables.

For larger projects this can be a big time savings, as well as being more discoverable.  

I use the -run=xxx thing all the time to find places where tests won't compile from changes in code.

Well, there is `go test -c -o /dev/null`.  That does the link step, but it doesn't run anything.

You can't use -c with multiple packages, though, and that's where a -compile would really help.

```
$ go test -c -o /dev/null ./...
cannot use -c flag with multiple packages
```

Dup of #15513, closing here in favour of the older thread.

--- Comment #4 by rsc ---

This proposal is a duplicate of a previously discussed proposal, as noted above,
and there is no significant new information to justify reopening the discussion.
The issue has therefore been **[declined as a duplicate](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined-as-duplicate)**.
