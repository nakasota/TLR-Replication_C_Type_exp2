Please explain what kind of code would want to use this.  Thanks.

--- Comment #2 by GuruneLee ---
I used to parse the **HTTP multipart Request** to receive an image and meta-data sent by client. 
But I couldn't find a function to access **Value** entity of parsed **Request** with *ParseMultipartForm()* function
(But there is the function for **File** entity)

image01. MutipartForm in **Request Structure**

image02. **Value** entity

What do you need that is not available in the `net/http.Request.Form` field?

--- Comment #4 by antichris ---
... Or by a call of the `net/http.Request.FormValue()` method. Or in the `net/http.Request.MultipartForm` field.

I think the real issue here is a malfunction in the chair-to-keyboard interface. The author had not read the documentation and now, when given an answer they would've just as easily came up with on their own [had they bothered to do so][docs] first, they no longer care about this "proposal" of theirs — as evidenced by 3+ weeks of zero activity.

@antichris Please be mindful of the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).  Please be charitable to all members of the community.

--- Comment #6 by antichris ---
@ianlancetaylor, I see your point. But I am also concerned that the approach you chose to take here may not serve as a particularly effective deterrent for individuals like these further abusing Go proposals as their personal StackOverflow. I only meant to help.

--- Comment #7 by ianlancetaylor ---
@antichris Help is appreciated, but please help in a respectful and charitable way.  Thanks.

--- Comment #8 by rsc ---
The discussion, although not as respectful as it could have been, seems to have pointed out that access to this information is already possible in the current API.

--- Comment #9 by rsc ---

This proposal has been added to the [active column](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#active) of the proposals project
and will now be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

--- Comment #10 by rsc ---

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely decline](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-decline)**.

--- Comment #11 by rsc ---

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
