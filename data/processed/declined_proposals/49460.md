==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: go2: constraint for type with particular type parameter

==== [Issue Body] ====
It would be good to be able to add a constraint for a generic type with a particular type parameter specified.

I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.  Can you give an example for what this would look like?  Thanks.

```go

type GenericStruct[K comparable] struct {
	keys  []K
}

type customConstraint interface {
	type GenericStruct[string]  // <------------------------- constraint with generic struct constraint to particular type
}

func GenericFunction[K customConstraint]() {
	return 
}

```


--- Comment #3 by DeedleFake ---
This already works exactly as you seem to be describing:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Test[T any] []T

type Constraint interface {
	Test[int] | Test[string]
}

func DoSomething[T Constraint](v T) {
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", v)
}

func main() {
	DoSomething(Test[int]{3, 2, 5})
	DoSomething(Test[string]{"a", "b", "c"})
	DoSomething(Test[float64]{3, 2, 5}) // Correctly fails to compile.
}
```

It doesn't seem likely to be particularly useful very often, though.
