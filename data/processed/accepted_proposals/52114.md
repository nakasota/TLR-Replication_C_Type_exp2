Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52114

==== [Issue Title] ====
x/net/http2: add DialTLSContext to Transport

==== [Issue Body] ====
[net.Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Transport) contains DialContext, but [http2.Transport](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/http2#Transport) only contains DialTLS, so a similar DialTLSContext has been added to make http.Transport support context.

What's changed:

https://github.com/golang/net/blob/8e4df14915a2b0bef8fb1a2d5f67f1bcedc6ab31/http2/transport.go#L66-L88

This proposal only adds a new API, so there is no breaking change.

It seems like we clearly need DialTLSContext given that it's already in http.Transport.

FYI https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50392 is a duplicate (rather, was written first, but the PR and this issue were written after without linking to it)

Change https://go.dev/cl/377114 mentions this issue: `http2: add DialTLSContext to Transport`
