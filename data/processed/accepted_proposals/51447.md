x/exp/winfsnotify: delete package

==== [Issue Body] ====
The `x/exp/winfsnotify` package was moved from the standard library to the `x/exp` repository in [CL 7456047](https://golang.org/cl/7456047), a little over nine years ago. It has apparently not been touched since then except to add an `// import` comment in 2014. In 2016, users discussed switching to an externally-maintained alternative (see @nathany's comment in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17244#issuecomment-250935437).

At least one such alternative, [`github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify), was still actively maintained at least as of this January (see https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/413), and has a number of volunteers to maintain it going forward.

In the meantime `x/exp/winfsnotify` has rotted. It has no active owners and its only substantial test is flaky (#49734). The corresponding `fsnotify` package for Unix platforms was removed in [CL 3990](https://golang.org/cl/3990), back in 2015.

The packages in the `x/exp` repository are explicitly experimental. I propose that we declare the `x/exp/winfsnotify` experiment concluded and delete the package.

Given the overwhelming evidence, I think we can make this a direct accept.

No change in consensus, so **[accepted](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#accepted)**. 🎉
This issue now tracks the work of implementing the proposal.

@bcmills one think we should consider is checking in a go.mod in that directory first, before the delete, so that if anyone really does need it, they can use it as a separate submodule even if they also need a newer x/exp for other reasons.


--- Comment #5 by bcmills ---
That seems reasonable. Probably we should also add a deprecation notice to the tombstone version, and tag it something like `winfsnotify/v0.1.0-deprecated` so that it can be resolved from the version list.

Change https://go.dev/cl/399834 mentions this issue: `winfsnotify: deprecate package and isolate it to its own module`

--- Comment #7 by bcmills ---
This is done: the `winfsnotify` package no longer exists at `HEAD`, but remains available in module `golang.org/x/exp/winfsnotify` at its terminal version `v0.1.0-deprecated`.

I've also confirmed that the documentation for the final, deprecated version is correctly shown at https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/winfsnotify.
