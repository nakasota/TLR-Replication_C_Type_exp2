Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52038

==== [Issue Title] ====
spec: adjust scope of type parameters declared by method receivers

==== [Issue Body] ====
This proposal is about a small correction to the scope of function type parameters.
Per the [current spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope):

> The scope of an identifier denoting a type parameter of a function or declared by a method receiver is the function body and all parameter lists of the function.

The proposal is to change this rule to:

> The scope of an identifier denoting a type parameter of a function or declared by a method receiver _starts after the function name and ends at the end of the function body_.

There is only a difference for methods of generic types: type parameters declared by method receivers won't be visible in the receiver parameter list anymore. For example, currently we get an error for:

```Go
type T[T any] struct {}

func (T[T]) m() {} // error: T is not a generic type
```

because the `T` inside the `[T]` is visible inside the receiver parameter list and shadows the outer `T` used in front of `[T]`.

If this proposal is accepted, it will be possible to write this code without errors.

See #51503.

Given that `type T[T any] struct {}` works today, it does seem reasonable to try to make `func (T[T]) m() {}` work too.
