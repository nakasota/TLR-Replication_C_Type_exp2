==== [Issue Title] ====
cmd/go: add -e flag to 'go get -u'

==== [Issue Body] ====
A missing dependency currently blocks `go get -u` from working at all. For a concrete example, see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28424#issuecomment-1175438836.

`go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` have a `-e` flag that means: "attempt to proceed despite errors
encountered while loading packages". I propose that we add an analogous `-e` flag to `go get -u`.

This would make it easier to start an upgrade by running `go get -e -u ./...` and then fixing up the build failures through subsequent code changes (such as adjusting `import` statements within the main module). That seems like a completely reasonable workflow to me.

We do already have some logic in module-mode `go get` that attempts to suppress errors for transitive imports for as long as possible:
https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/cmd/go/internal/modget/get.go;l=1072-1084;drc=19309779ac5e2f5a2fd3cbb34421dafb2855ac21

So I think this would probably boil down to suppressing a couple of calls to `base.SetExitStatus` very late in the `go get` command:
https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/cmd/go/internal/modget/get.go;l=1476-1494;drc=19309779ac5e2f5a2fd3cbb34421dafb2855ac21

For such a low cost, this seems worth the usability benefit.
