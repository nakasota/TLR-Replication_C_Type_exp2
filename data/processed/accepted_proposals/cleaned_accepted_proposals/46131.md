=== Fetching Proposal: MDU6SXNzdWU4OTAzMDU5NjQ= ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46131

==== [Issue Title] ====
reflect: add MapIter.SetKey, SetValue, and friends

==== [Issue Body] ====
Over at https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32424#issuecomment-498758058, @randall77 suggests that a performance problem with map iteration can be fixed by adding MapIter.SetKey and MapIter.SetValue methods.

It's possible others should be changed but this is the most significant from a performance standpoint.
