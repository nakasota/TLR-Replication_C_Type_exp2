==== [Issue Title] ====
reflect: add StructField.IsExported and Method.IsExported

==== [Issue Body] ====
The `StructField.PkgPath` field is populated if and only if the field is unexported. However, there is a hit to readability:
```go
for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
    f := t.Field(i)
    if f.PkgPath != "" {
        continue
    }
    ...
}
```

It's not obvious to most readers why the `f.PkgPath != ""` check exist. For this reason, a vast majority of cases have a comment that says:
```go
    // Skip unexported fields.
    if f.PkgPath != "" {
        continue
    }
```

This documentation seems unnecessary if we had just added a helper method on `StructField` like:
```go
// IsExported reports whether the struct field is exported.
func (f StructField) IsExported() bool {
    return f.PkgPath == ""
}
```

Thus, use of it becomes obvious from a readability perspective:
```go
for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
    f := t.Field(i)
    if !f.IsExported() {
        continue
    }
    ...
}
```

Bikeshedding: I don't have a preference whether this should be called `IsExported` or simply `Exported`. The former matches `IsValid`, `IsNil`, or `IsZero`, while the latter matches `StructField.Anonymous`. It seems that the `reflect` package is already internally inconsistent about naming of predicate functionality.

==== [Comments] ====

--- Comment #1 by ianlancetaylor ---
Minor side note: the field name `Anonymous` is already wrong, as we now refer to that concept as an embedded field.  So although we can't change `Anonymous` we shouldn't take it as a precedent for anything.

--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
I'm OK with adding IsExported() bool.
I wouldn't want to add a new struct field that could be out of sync with PkgPath.


--- Comment #3 by rsc ---
Based on the discussion above, this seems like a **likely accept**.
