==== [Issue Title] ====
io: implement WriterTo on result of MultiReader

==== [Issue Body] ====
I have a program where I use `io#MultiReader` to concatenate a `bytes#Buffer` with a `*os#File`.

However doing that I loose zero copying on the file.

I added `io#WriterTo` to `io#MultiReader` and in my case that makes the copy loop of my app about 120 times faster. I am performing zero-copies of big file, this explain such jump.

Anyway I think you shouldn't loose zero copy on `MultiReader`.
