==== [Issue Title] ====
cmd/go: continue conversion to bug-resistant //go:build constraints

==== [Issue Body] ====
In June I posted a [draft design](https://golang.org/s/go-build-design) for moving from `// +build` lines with ad-hoc syntax to `//go:build` lines with standard Boolean expressions; that doc also has links to a video overview and a prototype implementation.

I propose that we adopt this design, with N = 17 in the [Transition](https://golang.org/s/go-build-design#transition) section, meaning that the prep work would happen in Go 1.16, the main change would land in Go 1.17, and the transition would be finalized in Go 1.18.

Based on the emoji above and the lack of any objections (along with the overwhelmingly positive Reddit thread), this seems like a **likely accept**.
