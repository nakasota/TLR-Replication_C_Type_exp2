==== [Issue Title] ====
embed: remove type spelling restrictions

==== [Issue Body] ====
In https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43217#issuecomment-755059106 I suggested two changes:

 - Drop the import restriction for embed.
 - Drop the type spelling restrictions for embed.

The reaction is for the most part overwhelmingly positive. But dropping the import restriction has generated some important discussion, while dropping the type spelling restriction seems completely uncontroversial.

I've forked this issue off of #43217 to track only dropping the type spelling restriction. Then #43217 can be only about dropping the import restriction.
