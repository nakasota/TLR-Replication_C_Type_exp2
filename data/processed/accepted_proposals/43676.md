=== Fetching Proposal: MDU6SXNzdWU3ODU0ODgxNTk= ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43676

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: x/website: golang.org/s: print an index at the root

==== [Issue Body] ====
The URL shortener for the golang.org web site, golang.org/s/ contains useful historical links, but I cannot discover a way to see the list. Both golang.org/s and golang.org/s/index produce

`
not found
`

A simple feature request: golang.org/s could list the entries.

==== [Comments] ====

--- Comment #1 by changkun ---
I was interested in all `/s` links, but could not find a way to view them. So I searched these places: 1) the source code 2) all commit messages 3) golang-nuts 4) golang-dev 5) wiki 6) google and summarized most of them as a list at [golang.design/history](https://github.com/golang-design/history).

People who interested in this, can search from the [README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang-design/history/master/README.md) document via `golang.org/s`, here are some of them (not sure if there are more):

@changkun here's one you're missing:

- https://golang.org/s/owners

--- Comment #3 by robpike ---
@changkun Thanks very much! But I'd still like the site to offer its own, automatically maintained index.

--- Comment #4 by changkun ---
We would love that feature too :)

--- Comment #5 by gopherbot ---
Change https://golang.org/cl/283753 mentions this issue: `x/website: golang.org/s: print an index at the root`

--- Comment #6 by rsc ---
I can see the full index, and it's kind of full of junk.
I'm not convinced that publishing the full table of junk is worthwhile.
Even worse, there are clearly links there that were created assuming
that the full names and links would not be made into a public table.
(You can argue that was a mistake, but they exist.)

If we are going to publish an index on /s, there should be a separate
"public bool" bit stored with each link that must be set explicitly
for a link to appear in the index.

Please do NOT do this, at least not without adding that bit.

--- Comment #7 by changkun ---
Thanks for the clarification about the junk and privately created links. Then I don't think that the community can do anything about this as the sent CL was done blindly by just reading the code and marking public bool would require admin permission to at least view them all. Still looking forward to the feature be launched in the future as reason commented previously.

--- Comment #8 by robpike ---
I have made this a proposal to try to force discussion and closure.

--- Comment #9 by rsc ---
I don't think we really need a proposal. I am happy to add this feature as long as there is a public/private bit too.
I'm already working on golang.org recently. If you leave it for me, I will implement it.
