=== Fetching Proposal: MDU6SXNzdWU1Nzg1ODYyNjU= ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37776

==== [Issue Title] ====
net/url: add URL.RawFragment, like RawPath

==== [Issue Body] ====
OpenAPI and JSONSchema do fancy things with the fragment including
funny path operations that distinguish between a literal / and an escaped %2f.
Just like happened with Path, the solution is probably to add RawFragment,
with the same semantics for Fragment/RawFragment as Path/RawPath.

Adding to the proposal minutes. This seems fairly unobjectionable given the precedent set by RawPath. If anyone thinks we shouldn't do this, please speak up. Thanks.


--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
Based on the precedent from RawPath and the lack of any objections, this seems like a **likely accept**.


--- Comment #3 by rsc ---
No change in consensus (still crickets here), so accepting.


--- Comment #4 by gopherbot ---
Change https://golang.org/cl/227645 mentions this issue: `net/url: add URL.RawFragment, URL.EscapedFragment`
