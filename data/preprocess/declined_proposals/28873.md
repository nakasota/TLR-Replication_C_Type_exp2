==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: encoding/asn1: add "enum" keyword for TagEnum

==== [Issue Body] ====
Adding an "enum" tag option helps keeping the code clean.

for example:

the following code:
```
type tEnum int

const (
	tZero tEnum = iota
	tOne
)

type enumTest struct {
	A tEnum `asn1:"enum"`
}

func sampleTest(t *testing.T) {

	myTest := enumTest{A: tOne}

	buf, err := Marshal(myTest)
}
```
as compared to 

```
type tEnum int

const (
	tZero tEnum = iota
	tOne
)

type enumTest struct {
	A tEnum
}
type enumStruct struct {
	A Enumerated
}

func sampleTest(t *testing.T) {

	myTest := enumTest{A: tOne}

	enum := enumStruct{A: Enumerated(int(myTest.A))}
	buf, err := Marshal(enum)
}
```
*note* the enumStruct is completely redundant and is used solely for getting an enum tag in the buffer

Same goes for Unmarshal, you need an intermediate structure if you want to have you own enumerated types.

This is very old and I can't tell what is being proposed. If this is still an active concern, please file a new proposal. Thanks.
