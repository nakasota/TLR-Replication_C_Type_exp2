==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: x/net/html: add PrependChild and InsertAfter to Node

==== [Issue Body] ====
I have already made a [PR](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/net/+/329734#message-76ec3fbde91aa9fc6003938ff3ba6cacc24e2f42), but @neild said I should create a proposal.

The following is the commit message of the commit in my PR:

```
html: add PrependChild and InsertAfter

These methods complement the already existing AppendChild and
InsertBefore methods in allowing for easy and safe manipulation of
Node trees.

For example code like

oldChild.Parent.InsertBefore(newChild, oldChild.NextSibling)

can now be written like

oldChild.Parent.InsertAfter(newChild, oldChild)

and code like

node.InsertBefore(newNode, node.FirstChild)

can now be written like

node.PrependChild(newNode)
```

Can you give a short example showing when a program would want to use these new methods?  Thanks.

Sure. I am writing a static site generator which renders pages by combining a layout HTML file with HTML files containing the content of each page. The repetitive parts of the pages reside in the layout file and the unique content are in the content files. The content files start with a front-matter containing metadata about the page, such as its title and description. 

For example if we have the content page
```html
<!--{
"title": "The title of the page",
"description": "Page description"
}-->

<p>here is a paragraph</p>

<h2>And a subheading</h2>
<p>And another paragraph</p>
```
the program would first insert all elements after the front-matter into the layout. It would then insert a `h1` and `p` based on the metadata:

```go
// Insert the page title heading
pageTitle := &html.Node{
Type: html.ElementNode,
Data: "h1",
DataAtom: atom.H1,
}
pageTitle.AppendChild(&html.Node{
Type: html.TextNode,
Data: titleFieldInFrontMatter,
})
main.PrependChild(pageTitle)

// Insert the page description paragraph
pageDescription := &html.Node{
Type: html.ElementNode,
Data: "p",
DataAtom: atom.P,
}
pageDescription.AppendChild(&html.Node{
Type: html.TextNode,
Data: descriptionFieldInFrontMatter,
})
pageTitle.Parent.InsertAfter(pageDescription, pageTitle)
```

Sorry, this did not turn out short after all \:D

This proposal has been added to the [active column](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#active) of the proposals project
and will now be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

The methods that are already there - AppendChild and InsertBefore - are a complete set in the sense that they provide all possible functionality. Do we really need to add a second complete set? 

Also, if your program finds that it needs these frequently, it is easy to write them as local helper functions, either using AppendChild and InsertBefore or using direct manipulation of the Nodes.

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely decline](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-decline)**.

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
