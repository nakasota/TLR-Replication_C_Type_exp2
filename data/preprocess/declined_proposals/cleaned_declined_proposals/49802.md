==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: x/sync: add panicgroup struct to deal with panic in the sub-goroutine

==== [Issue Body] ====
### What did you do?
In Go,Unable to receive the panic of the sub-goroutine in the parent-goroutine.
``` go
func main() {
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("recover()")
		}
		return
	}()
	g, _ := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())
	g.Go(func() error {
		panic("this is a panic")
	})

	if err := g.Wait(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("occur err")
		return
	}
	time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("success")
	return
}
```

output:
```
panic: this is a panic

goroutine 6 [running]:

...
...
```

### What did you expect to see?

What I hope is that there can be a structure similar to `errgroup`, like `panicgroup` to deal with the appearance of panic in the sub-goroutine.

### PS

I can implement this function if needed

Seems like a duplicate of #40484, which hasn't come to a clear resolution on even proposing an API change.


--- Comment #3 by rsc ---

This proposal is a duplicate of a previously discussed proposal, as noted above,
and there is no significant new information to justify reopening the discussion.
The issue has therefore been **[declined as a duplicate](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined-as-duplicate)**.
