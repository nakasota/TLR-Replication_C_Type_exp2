==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: log: add flag to display ISO 8601 date and time format

==== [Issue Body] ====
go version go1.12.9 linux/amd64

```
package main

import "log"

func main() {
	log.Println("foobar")
}
```

Output:  `2019/09/19 22:49:58 foobar`

There is no option to specify the output format with the timezone included.

The `LUTC` flag will log the date/time in UTC. This should be enough to then convert to a local timezone. Does this satisfy your requirement?

I think it would be better to add a new flag to output the ISO 8601 format directly. Like in the Unix 'date' command:
```
$ date --iso-8601=seconds
2019-10-17T22:13:31+02:00
```
No need to convert between timezones, just print the time **with** timezone information.

Marking this as proposal so it goes through the appropriate channels.

We can add an infinite number of flags to package log to format the time.
If you need a specific formatting of the time, it seems like it makes more sense to call log.SetOutput with a custom io.Writer that inserts the time itself.

Something like this could suffice: https://play.golang.org/p/Ky4tu3FSHhV

Thanks @smasher164.
It seems like this is a **likely decline** - it's not common enough to be worth adding to the core API and it can be easily implemented outside.

Leaving open for a week for final comments.

No change in consensus, so **declining**.
