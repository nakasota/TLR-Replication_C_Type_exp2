==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: net: customize dnsConfig

==== [Issue Body] ====
dnsConfig currently reflects the contents of /etc/resolv.conf, and reread regularly.

I hope can customize dnsConfig , and only once.

It should be helpful. Thanks very much!

Could you provide some detail about what you want  to customize and how? A code example would be good. Thanks.

add dnsConfig

```golang
type Resolver struct {
	// PreferGo controls whether Go's built-in DNS resolver is preferred
	// on platforms where it's available. It is equivalent to setting
	// GODEBUG=netdns=go, but scoped to just this resolver.
	PreferGo bool

	// StrictErrors controls the behavior of temporary errors
	// (including timeout, socket errors, and SERVFAIL) when using
	// Go's built-in resolver. For a query composed of multiple
	// sub-queries (such as an A+AAAA address lookup, or walking the
	// DNS search list), this option causes such errors to abort the
	// whole query instead of returning a partial result. This is
	// not enabled by default because it may affect compatibility
	// with resolvers that process AAAA queries incorrectly.
	StrictErrors bool

	// Dial optionally specifies an alternate dialer for use by
	// Go's built-in DNS resolver to make TCP and UDP connections
	// to DNS services. The host in the address parameter will
	// always be a literal IP address and not a host name, and the
	// port in the address parameter will be a literal port number
	// and not a service name.
	// If the Conn returned is also a PacketConn, sent and received DNS
	// messages must adhere to RFC 1035 section 4.2.1, "UDP usage".
	// Otherwise, DNS messages transmitted over Conn must adhere
	// to RFC 7766 section 5, "Transport Protocol Selection".
	// If nil, the default dialer is used.
	Dial func(ctx context.Context, network, address string) (Conn, error)

	// lookupGroup merges LookupIPAddr calls together for lookups for the same
	// host. The lookupGroup key is the LookupIPAddr.host argument.
	// The return values are ([]IPAddr, error).
	lookupGroup singleflight.Group

	// TODO(bradfitz): optional interface impl override hook
	// TODO(bradfitz): Timeout time.Duration?
	
	
	// add dnsConfig	
	DnsConfig *dnsConfig
}
```

net/dnsclient_unix.go:567

try to read dnsConfig of the resolver

```golang
func (r *Resolver) goLookupIPCNAMEOrder(ctx context.Context, network, name string, order hostLookupOrder) (addrs []IPAddr, cname dnsmessage.Name, err error) {
	if order == hostLookupFilesDNS || order == hostLookupFiles {
		addrs = goLookupIPFiles(name)
		if len(addrs) > 0 || order == hostLookupFiles {
			return addrs, dnsmessage.Name{}, nil
		}
	}
	if !isDomainName(name) {
		// See comment in func lookup above about use of errNoSuchHost.
		return nil, dnsmessage.Name{}, &DNSError{Err: errNoSuchHost.Error(), Name: name, IsNotFound: true}
	}
	
	// try to read dnsConfig of the resolver
	var conf *dnsConfig
	if r.DnsConfig != nil {
		conf = r.DnsConfig
	} else {
		resolvConf.tryUpdate("/etc/resolv.conf")
		resolvConf.mu.RLock()
		conf = resolvConf.dnsConfig
		resolvConf.mu.RUnlock()
	}
	...
}

I guess you also need some API to set up the DnsConfig (as the type is unexported)?

Changing to a proposal as this adds new API.

Yes! Thank you very much!

--- Comment #5 by ianlancetaylor ---
Note that the `dnsConfig` type only exists on Unix, it does not exist on Windows or Plan 9.

I think that in order to understand this proposal we need a complete description of all the API change involved.  Simply adding a `DNSConfig` field to `Resolver` won't help at all.  So what do we need?

--- Comment #6 by rsc ---
We clearly can't add a new exported field of an unexported, os-specific type.
What would you use the DNS config for?

It seems like maybe using https://github.com/miekg/dns would be more appropriate in this case?

This proposal has been added to the [active column](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#active) of the proposals project
and will now be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

--- Comment #8 by rsc ---

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely decline](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-decline)**.
— rsc for the proposal review group


--- Comment #9 by rsc ---

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
