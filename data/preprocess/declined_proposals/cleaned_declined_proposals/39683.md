proposal: x/exp/mmap: expose a File-like type

==== [Issue Body] ====
right now, with the current `mmap.ReaderAt` type, one can easily (and from multiple goroutines) access mmap'ed data.

that's great.

but my application A also needs an `io.Reader`.
I've resorted to forking the `x/exp/mmap` package under [go-mmap/mmap](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-mmap/mmap), that exposes a `Reader` type that implements `io.Reader`, `io.Seeker`, `io.ReaderAt` and `io.ByteReader`.

now, in yet another application (B), to interface with a FPGA board, I'd also need write access.

it comes to reason to thus expose a `File`-like type, implementing also `io.Writer`, `io.WriterAt` and `io.ByteWriter`.

Is there a reason you can't (or shouldn't) wrap it in an [`io.SectionReader`](https://pkg.go.dev/io?tab=doc#SectionReader)?

--- Comment #2 by sbinet ---
no, I just didn't think about `io.SectionReader` (which is sad b/c I do use it quite extensively in other parts of "application A")

but for "application B", I would need r/w capabilities (to interact with a Cyclone V FPGA board)

You could easily fork SectionReader and create SectionWriter. Writing to a fixed area is not particularly common though, so it might not be worth putting in io itself.

It does seem like the general adapters are better than more functionality in package mmap itself.

Based on the discussion above, this seems like a **likely decline**.

No change in consensus, so declined.
