==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: databse/sql: add NullUint64 

==== [Issue Body] ====
Hey! I maintain an entity framework for Go named [ent](https://github.com/ent/ent), and we're having troubles handling nullable uint64 types as the official `sql` package doesn't support it. Using `NullInt64` is not enough as some databases accept values that are greater than 2^63−1.

Since the `sql.convertAssign` function is private my 2 options are either copy its code or use the `//go:linkname` directive.

Change https://golang.org/cl/344410 mentions this issue: `database/sql: add NullUint64`

--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
Today we have:

```
type NullBool struct{ ... }
type NullByte struct{ ... }
type NullFloat64 struct{ ... }
type NullInt16 struct{ ... }
type NullInt32 struct{ ... }
type NullInt64 struct{ ... }
type NullString struct{ ... }
type NullTime struct{ ... }
```

Are you suggesting we add all the uint sizes, or just uint64? Why?

Hey @rsc and thanks for responding.

The `NullUint64` is required for [ent](https://github.com/ent/ent) atm to support scanning null uint64 values because using `NullInt64` returns a `value out of range` error if the value is greater than 2^63−1. 

If you see any concern with adding the rest of the unit types, it can wait for the "generics" change, because they can be implemented externally with `NullUint64`.

Most SQL databases don't support uints; though some do. I would recommend we wait for a generic version to land. I was working on one when I encountered a compiler error at tip; once that is resolved I can look into it more.

I recommend against this proposal.

Thanks for the feedback @kardianos 🙏 
 
I don't think it matters if the database supports unsigned integers or not, it can also be defined as `(numeric(20,0) check (c >= 0 and c <= 2^64-1))`, and we should still be able to scan its value to the native `uint64` type without using an external package.

Currently, `Rows.Scan` (`convertAssignRows`) **does work** with `uint64`, but if the column is nullable, we have no way to work around this except for using the `sql.convertAssign` function directly or copying it.

As I mentioned above, unlike `NullByte` and `NullInt16` (that were added by me on 1.17), the `NullUint64` type can't be implemented easily outside the `sql` package, and I don't think we should be blocked for at least a year until generics will be stable. 


--- Comment #6 by rsc ---
NullUint64 seems fine in isolation and is the only sized unsigned int type that can't be shoehorned into a signed type instead. @kardianos are you OK with adding NullUint64, or do you want to wait for a generic Null[T]?

This proposal has been added to the [active column](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#active) of the proposals project
and will now be reviewed at the weekly proposal review meetings.

Thanks for opening this @a8m, on behalf of the Ent community I join your proposal 🙏 

--- Comment #9 by kardianos ---
@rsc I would prefer to wait for a generic Null. Unsigned types are not common in databases.

--- Comment #10 by rsc ---

Based on the discussion above, this proposal seems like a **[likely decline](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#likely-decline)**.

> Unsigned types are not common in databases.

Hey @kardianos and @rsc, please read my previous comment. It's unrelated to the fact that MySQL and MariaDB support unsigned integers. The motivation to support `NullUint64` comes from the application perspective. Applications should be able to scan nullable values to unsigned integers. `uint64` is already supported by `convertAssign`, but since this function is not exported, **`NullUint64` can't be implemented externally** like the other`Null<T>` types, because they use this function.

--- Comment #12 by rsc ---

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
