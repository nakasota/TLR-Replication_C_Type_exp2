==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: testing: add assertion methods

==== [Issue Body] ====
It's very common to use packages like [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) or [is](https://github.com/matryer/is) as a set of helper methods that make testing code more readable. The reason behind using packages like that is to avoid writing repetitive code like the following.

```go
func TestAddition(t *testing.T) {
  given := 2+4
  expected := 4

  if given != expected {
    t.Errorf("expected %d but %d given", expected, given)
  }
}
```

The `if` statement with the error message can be repeated even a hundred times. That's why we use external libraries to avoid that.

As we have generics in the language, we can make use of it and provide a new method in `testing.T` and `testing.B`:

```go
func (t T) Equal[T comparable](expected, given T) {
  // comparing
  t.Fail()
}

func (t T) Equalf[T comparable](expected, given T, format string, args ...string) {
  // comparing
  t.Fail()
}
```

The first snipped would be simplified into:
```go
func TestAddition(t *testing.T) {
  given := 2+4
  expected := 4

  t.Equal(expected, given)
}

func TestAddition2(t *testing.T) {
  given := 2+4
  expected := 4

  t.Equalf(expected, given, "math should always work")
}
```

Using generics has a big benefit over using `any` - we have a compile-time type check.

I know that saving those 2 lines of code doesn't seem to be a big win but please remember that the code may be repeated many times in a single test file.

Note we recommend against assertion libraries in TestComments https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TestComments#assert-libraries

--- Comment #2 by ianlancetaylor ---
See also https://go.dev/doc/faq#assertions.  This is an intentional choice.

--- Comment #3 by icholy ---
@seankhliao on the page you linked, the functions in that example `assert` package should be title cased.

``` go
assert.IsNotNil(t, "obj", obj)
assert.StringEq(t, "obj.Type", obj.Type, "blogPost")
assert.IntEq(t, "obj.Comments", obj.Comments, 2)
assert.StringNotEq(t, "obj.Body", obj.Body, "")
```
