I wonder if plan to support \C to match a single byte?



==== [Comments] ====

--- Comment #1 by ianlancetaylor ---
Are there any other regular expression variants that support that?

--- Comment #2 by syinwu ---
I didn't see any other regular expression variants of golang that support \C. I see the use of it in the syntax wiki of re2.

--- Comment #3 by rsc ---
There are no plans, because it requires operating one byte at a time, and the regexp implementation is fundamentally rune-at-a-time.
