==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: cmd/gofmt: treat one line if-statements as it does one line function definitions

==== [Issue Body] ====
Currently, gofmt will change:

    func hi(){fmt.Println("Hi.")}
    func bye(){
    fmt.Println("Bye.")}

into:

    func hi() { fmt.Println("Hi.") }
    func bye() {
        fmt.Println("Bye.")
    }

The tool could apply this to if-statements as well. 

One line if-statements are controversial, and so my code reviewer and I believe that we should leave that choice to the user rather than requiring multi-line if-statements. We already leave this choice to the user in the case of function definitions, and so I was hoping that this wouldn't be much more work than that.

Our motivation for one line if-statements is that something like:

`if choice == "" { choice = default }
`

is less distracting and arguably more readable than:

```
if choice == "" {
  choice = default
}
```

Thank you!
