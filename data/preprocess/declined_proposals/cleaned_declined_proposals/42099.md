==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: reflect: add Type.QualifiedString

==== [Issue Body] ====
#22075 makes it such that `NumMethod` no longer counts unexported methods for interfaces (and by implication the inability to obtain information about unexported methods).

One use case this breaks is https://github.com/google/go-cmp/blob/566225a2554cf156c7af1006dc3a0940e1e02b09/cmp/internal/value/name.go#L133-L146, where the goal is to print fully-qualified type information about a Go type (i.e., `reflect.Type.String` is insufficiently detailed). With the `NumMethod` change, I can no longer print unnamed interfaces in a way where users can tell that they are different.

I propose we add a `reflect.Type.QualifiedString` method that ensures the following property:
```
t1.QualifiedString() == t2.QualifiedString() if and only if t1 == t2
```

I don't have any strong preferences for the content of the string other than it be a humanly readable representation of the type. If the output is Go syntax, perhaps the method can be called `GoString`.

See also #41896.

We are probably going to roll back that change - see #42123 - so it looks like we don't need this.

Since we rolled back that change, this seems like a **likely decline**.


--- Comment #4 by dsnet ---
I'm abandoning my proposal.
