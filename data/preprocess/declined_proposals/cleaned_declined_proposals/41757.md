==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: flag: Introduce functions for defining rune flag

==== [Issue Body] ====
Currently the `flag` package has functions for parsing `string`.

In order use a `rune` flag one has to 

1. define it as `string` flag
2. check rune count using `utf8.RuneCountInString` to know if is has one or more rune.
3. if rune count is more than one, produce an error or call `flag.Usage` and exit. ( But the usage information
    that `flag.Usage` gives will contain `-flag string` for that flag. so it requires to add `` `rune` `` to that flag's usage
    information to get  `flag.Usage` show `-flag rune` for that flag's usage information. )
4. type cast it to `[]rune`
5. get the first `rune` by using index `0`

The need for a flag that accepts a single rune seems 1) rare; 2) easy to implement by implementing the `flag.Value` interface.  What is the argument for putting this in the standard library?  See https://golang.org/doc/faq#x_in_std.

I'm at a loss to remember any program I've ever used that took a flag argument that was itself (the argument) required to be a single letter.

Note that you can implement this yourself using the new flag.Func (will be in Go 1.16) or using flag.Value.
