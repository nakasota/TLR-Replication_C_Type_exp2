==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: strings: add StripSlashes like PHP stripslashes

==== [Issue Body] ====
Provide a new function, like any other language, function can Un-quotes a quoted string.

Describe:
Returns a string with backslashes stripped off. (\' becomes ' and so on.) 
Double backslashes (\\) are made into a single backslash (\).

For example:
```golang
fmt.Println(StripSlashes(`\\\\1`))  
// will print  "\\1"
```
other language function like: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stripslashes.php

Please describe exactly what the proposed function will do.  For example, please give the documentation comment that would appear in https://golang.org/pkg/strings.  Thanks.

Doesn't strconv.Unquote do the job you need? You need to attach double quotes to the string, but that is a trivial adjustment.

If the string contains quotation marks in the middle.It looks more difficult to handle.

--- Comment #4 by robpike ---
That is unfortunate, but the code is telling you the truth: That string is not a valid Go string to be unquoted, as it contains unescaped double quotes. You are asking to solve a problem that is not well defined within the Go environment.

Go has distinct rules for backslashes that are context-dependent. \" is legal only in a double-quoted string, while \' is legal only in a rune constant. That is why strconv.Unquote requires the quote character to be included: it defines the rules for unquoting.

You are asking for a new set of rules, and so it seems unlikely to be something needed in the standard Go library. I suggest you write the code that does what you need, and use.

PHP stripslashes is essentially PHP unquote, as far as I can tell. 
If you need to unquote Go strings, use strconv.Unquote.
If you need to unquote another syntax, you should use a syntax-specific unquoter.
It's impossible to write a "generic" unquoter because you wouldn't know which syntaxes to allow or not.

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
