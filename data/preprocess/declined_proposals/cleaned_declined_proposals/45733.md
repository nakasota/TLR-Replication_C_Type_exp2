==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: cmd/go: test -json include file and line info

==== [Issue Body] ====
1. Clone a go repository
2. Change into the directory
3. Run `go test ./... -json`

Running this process you should see output such as:

```
{ "Action" : "fail", "Package" : "foo", "Test" : "bar" }
```

It would be useful to have fields of `filename` and `line_number` as well, indicating where the named test is defined.

go test -json runs test2json on the output of go test.
Since that info is not in the output, I don't see how we can add it.
More generally, it seems like programs can easily find the test by searching the files in the directory.
