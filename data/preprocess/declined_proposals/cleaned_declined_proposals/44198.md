==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: x/crypto/ssh add sshutil.ReverseProxy: a single host reverse proxy for SSH

==== [Issue Body] ====
## Proposal

Add a new `sshutil` package with the following import path
```golang
import "golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/sshutil"
```

In this new package, implement a single host reverse proxy, modeled after the `httputil.ReverseProxy` API. 


```golang
httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(targetURL).ServeHTTP(w, r)

err = sshutil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(targetHost, &clientConfig).Serve(ctx, conn, chans, reqs)
```

An example implementation can be found here: https://github.com/cmoog/sshutil

```golang
// NewSingleHostReverseProxy constructs a new *ReverseProxy instance.
func NewSingleHostReverseProxy(targetHost string, clientConfig *ssh.ClientConfig) *ReverseProxy

// Serve executes the reverse proxy between the specified target client hostname and the server connection.
func (r *ReverseProxy)  Serve(ctx context.Context, conn *ssh.ServerConn, chans <-chan ssh.NewChannel, reqs <-chan *ssh.Request) error
```

The implementation is relatively tricky for those unfamiliar with SSH internals, but serves a wide range of common use cases– similar in nature to the convenience of `httputil.ReverseProxy`.

Given that this already exists in an external package, it is unclear that we need to add more to x/crypto/ssh.
In general I think we're leaving x/crypto/ssh as it is and not adding new features there.

Generally, these kind of application-level (as opposed to protocol-level) implementations are a pain to maintain in the standard library: everyone needs to configure their application a little differently, and there is no specification for how they are supposed to work.

Specifically, HTTP reverse proxies run the Internet, while SSH reverse proxies are a fairly uncommon deployment. Bastions are usually hosts that relay a TCP connection, not authenticated clients.

This fits best in a third-party client.

Ok, fair points all around. Closing this out. Appreciate the consideration 👍

No change in consensus, so **[declined](https://golang.org/s/proposal-status#declined)**.
