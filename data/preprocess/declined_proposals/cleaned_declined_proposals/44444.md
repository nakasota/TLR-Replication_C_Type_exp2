What are the use cases for this, and how often does it come up that it needs to be in the standard library (with https://golang.org/doc/faq#x_in_std in mind)?

I see external brotli packages at https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=brotli.

--- Comment #4 by dsnet ---
Both zstandard and brotli seem promising to become the de-facto standard for compression, but that's something that requires the test of time. I don't think Brotli (or zstandard) experiences the pervasive use that gzip enjoys to justify it's addition to the standard library at this time and probably not for another half decade or so.

--- Comment #5 by zhaojizhuang ---
Yeah, according to the current frequency of brotli, maybe it is not the time to add brotli into the standard library.

Considering this retracted.
