=== Fetching Proposal: Deprecated proposals ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22741

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: x/crypto/ssh: add package for Key Revocation Lists

==== [Issue Body] ====
### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
```
go version go1.9.2 darwin/amd64
```

### What did you expect to see?
`x/crypto/ssh` has support for [SSH Certificates](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#Certificate) and an [`ssh.CertChecker.IsRevoked()`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#CertChecker) method, but there seems to not be support for OpenSSH's [Key Revocation List](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/PROTOCOL.krl?annotate=HEAD) (KRL) format. It would be useful to be able to marshal/unmarshal revocation lists for use by an OpenSSH server in Go.

@hanwen?

sounds like a useful feature. I think it could be separate subpackage of SSH.

--- Comment #3 by micahhausler ---
After digging around I found [stripe/krl](https://github.com/stripe/krl) which supports what I need. It might still be useful to have that functionality as a package under x/crypto/ssh, but its up to you all to keep this open or not.

This wasn't implemented for 2 years, and there's a third-party package that seems to meet the need, so reverting the Proposal-Accepted and bouncing it back to the committee. I think the lack of activity suggests we can do without it.

--- Comment #5 by rsc ---
Based on the discussion above and two years of inactivity after the initial acceptance, it sounds like this is a **likely decline** and that people who need KRLs can use https://github.com/stripe/krl. This does not seem like enough people need it to adopt it.

Leaving open for a week for final comments.

--- Comment #6 by rsc ---
No change in consensus, so **declined**.
