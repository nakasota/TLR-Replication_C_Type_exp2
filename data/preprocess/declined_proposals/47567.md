Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/47567

==== [Issue Title] ====
proposal: runtime: add GOEXE

==== [Issue Body] ====
### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

cross-platform go code has the same concerns as the "GOEXE" variable, effectively you want to append ".exe" if windows.

### Describe the solution you'd like

`runtime.GOEXE` which acts the same as "GOEXE" except it is a constant, so that windows binaries will know to look for .exe when launching commands.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Currently, we define `moreos.EXE` for this, using a constant based on the OS.
