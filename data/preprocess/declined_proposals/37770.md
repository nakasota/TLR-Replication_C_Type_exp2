## Feature Request - Test Case Export

Hi, All:
As we know, Golang built-in a nice test solution now, but can't export test case without real to run. 

In fact We're often want to export test case to a nice format then import to another test case management tool.

So, I am asking for a new feature to export test cases.

### What did you do?

The test case sample
```go
///coment for test function
func TestFooBar(t *testing.T) {
	///Comment for test case A
	t.Run("Test Case A",func (t *testing.T) {
		///Comment for test case 1
		t.Run("Test Case 1",func (t *testing.T) {

		})
		t.Run("Test Case 2",func (t *testing.T) {

		})
	})
	t.Run("Test Case B",func (t *testing.T) {
		t.Run("Test Case 1",func (t *testing.T) {

		})
		t.Run("Test Case 2",func (t *testing.T) {

		})
	})
}
```
### What did you expect to see?

```
[
  {
     "name" : "TestFooBar",
     "comment" : "coment for test function",
     "sub" : [
        {
			"name" : "Test Case A",
  			"comment" : "Comment for test case A",
			"sub" : [
				{
						"name" : "Test Case 1",
  						"comment" : "Comment for test case 1",
				},
				{
						"name" : "Test Case 2"
				}
			]
		},
		...
     ]
  }
]

```



### What did you see instead?

can't do it now.

--- Comment #1 by mvdan ---
A Go test with sub-tests is not a graph or table, though. You can have arbitrary code and logic. For example, this is common:

```
for _, test := range testTable {
    t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
        // ...
    })
}
```

This is why `go test -list` only lists top-level tests, and not sub-tests. Listing all sub-tests requires actually executing the tests, and might not show subtests which aren't meant to run on your platform.

As @mvdan points out, this is impossible to implement, since subtests can be computed. 
Declining the proposal as infeasible.
