==== [Issue Title] ====
all: make linux/arm64 a first-class port

==== [Issue Body] ====
Currently, linux/arm is a "[first class port](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/PortingPolicy#first-class-ports)" but linux/arm64 is not.

At this point, arm64 is probably equally or more important than arm.

I think we should add linux/arm64 to the first class port set.

There seems to be a strong consensus that we should do this, so it's a **likely accept**.

Leaving open for a week for final comments.


--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
No change in consensus, so **accepting**.

Updated the wiki page. Closing.

(#27689 remains open about figuring out the source of truth and/or synchronizing this information, but for now the wiki is canonical)
