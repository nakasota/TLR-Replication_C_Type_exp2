==== [Issue Title] ====
x/net: add xsrftoken.ValidFor

==== [Issue Body] ====
The `xrsftoken.Valid` function checks whether a token generated by `xsrftoken.Generate` was created within the last 24 hours.  Some services need to restrict tokens to shorter periods of time.

I propose a new function:

```Go
// ValidFor reports whether a token is a valid token returned by a call to Generate.
// The token is considered to be expired and invalid if it is older than the timeout duration.
func ValidFor(token, key, userID, actionID string, timeout time.Duration) bool
```
