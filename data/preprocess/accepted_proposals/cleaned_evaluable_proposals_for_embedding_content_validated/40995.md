all: add openbsd/mips64 port
track bug get openbsd/mips64 port upstream - code exist at:

thank make track issu @4a6f656c.
first entri is:

ask can't find answer issue, propos alreadi filed, futur task? intent use issu proposal?

@dmitshur
awar propos requir (obvious rel new addit page someth done eight go port author and/or upstream :). aside, would good requir go enforc done consist (for example, code exist go 1.15 releas incomplet port), mention take multipl month get builder key...
said, might well use issu propos (unless prefer/requir separ one):
- openbsd run octeon hardware, mips64 base - abl use go run go base softwar platform would beneficial.
- go toolchain alreadi support mips64 exist openbsd port (386, amd64, arm, arm64) - such, code requir port minim (effect openbsd/mips64 specif runtime, syscal glue).
- platform big endian, strict align larg physic page - variou aspect find bug code alreadi identifi bug go codebas (fix upstream if/when port lands).
- code port exist pass test go 1.15.
pleas let know detail required.
@4a6f656c problem complet understandable—th requir portingpolici page adjust recently, noticed. want move toward consist enforc requirements, chang part process.
use issu propos complet fine; re-titl mileston way. thank you.
@dmitshur kind time frame expect this?
@4a6f656c i’m sure. accord propos review meet happen approxim weekly, week may unusual.
@andybon better answer this?
propos review meet week.
given alreadi openbsd mips64, assum arrang builder seem fine fast-tracked. seem like **like accept**.
@4a6f656c take second gener builder key. took months, meant miss email reminded; sorri that. pleas ping us sooner happen again.
chang consensus, accepted.

openbsd/mips64 port complet stable, although function (primarili cgo) still missing. such, probabl qualifi inclus releas notes.
