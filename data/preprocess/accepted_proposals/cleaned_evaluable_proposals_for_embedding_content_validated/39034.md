time: add time.gostr method help %#v [freez exception]
array time.tim object retriev database, would like place go sourc file. understand it, there' easi way without helper method.
- `fmt.sprintf("%#v\n", t)` print someth like:
    ```go
    time.Time{wall:0x0, ext:63724924180, loc:(*time.Location)(nil)}
    ```
make difficult determin time repres - can't math 63724924180 head determin whether yesterday today, also can't embed directli go program `wall` `ext` `loc` privat variables.
- could use `t.format(time.rfc3339)` item get array strings, need re-parse'd get time.tim back, appropri error handling.
could nice either `(time.time) gostring() string` method `gostring` format constant would print format could embed go sourc file.
exampl
```
fmt.Sprintf(t.Format(time.GoString))
```
could yield
```
"time.Date(2020, time.February, 31, 23, 59, 59, 0, nil)"
```
similar. sure whether time.tim implement gostring interfac - chang format print `%#v` - would violat go compat promise, though doubt current `wall, ext, loc` format use people.
trickiest part would print `location`, could implement print pointer address non-nil, non-utc, non-loc locat - wors what' current done.
suppos also lose data monotonic- time measur question tri put sourc code like care bit.
ah, `t.format(time.gostring)` would work sinc string format would like insuffici print locat part need error handling. still could satisfi gostring interface.
realli sure need stdlib, trivial implement without `t.format`

struct
```go
type A struct {
     B time.Time
}
a := &A{B: time.Now()}
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", a)
```
suddenli need either implement custom format string everything, get time.time, hack someth like `printf("&a{b: %s}\n", togotime(a.b))` rebuild struct format around custom element formatting.
point gostring interfac exists.
see point, still easili wrap yeah nice.

mostli make sense, would hide monoton time any.
hi, ping here, think would help chang go 1.16, would love work interest.
chang mention issue: `time: add gostr method`
hi, 1.17 sourc tree open, would interest get feedback proposal. submit cl 267017 idea featur could implemented, could hope use jump point.
seem reason (still).
list minut week.
anyon object ad this?

stickiest point think repres `*time.location` value. common case `*time.location` - nil, utc, local - easi handle. howev case - fix zones, locat repres valu timezon database, like "america/los_angeles" - tricky.
1. one way would tri repres way repres nest pointer struct.
    ```go
    (*time.Location)(0xbadbcde)
    ```
understand runtime, would difficult get pointer address without import either `fmt` (which import reflect) `reflect` directly, get print pointer address. time packag allow import reflect russ point out.
suppos could special case `time.time` insid `fmt` packag someon ask gostr representation, sinc `fmt` allow import `reflect`, seem less ideal.
2. anoth way would convert fix zone, offset determin instant repres time. lose inform cases, would convert someth like "america/los_angeles" fix time zone fix offset.
    ```go
    time.FixedZone(loc.name, determineOffset(loc))
    ```
`loc` america/los_angel timezone, `determineoffset` would return `8*60*60` = 28800 time instant winter, `7*60*60` = 25200 time instant summer daylight save time active.
3. anoth way would print `time.location` valu lowercas `name` property. compile, would wors print today `%#v`, also compile. need build logic escap string case `name` field `"` charact need escaping.
    ```go
    time.Date(2020, time.February, 31, 23, 59, 59, 0, &time.Location{name: "America/Los_Angeles"}) 
    ./prog.go:9:79: cannot refer to unexported field 'name' in struct literal of type time.Location
     ```
4. anoth way would replac `time.loadlocation`, would also compil `loadlocation` return two values. think great idea, thought mention interest completeness.
    ```go
    time.Date(2020, time.February, 31, 23, 59, 59, 0, time.LoadLocation("America/Los_Angeles"))
    ./prog.go:9:81: multiple-value time.LoadLocation() in single-value context
     ```
these, think (3) best. think possibl implement (1) unless miss aspect runtim would make possibl retriev pointer without import reflect package.
gostr give _exact_ go syntax, think. print thing like 'main.t', go compil either. say time.location("name") would probabl fine.
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.

clear, believ current propos return string like:
time.date(2020, time.february, 31, 23, 59, 59, 0, time.utc)
time.date(2020, time.february, 31, 23, 59, 59, 0, time.location("americas/new_york")
yes, that' understand
chang consensus, **accepted**. 🎉
