crypto/x509: provid method gener conform serial number
currently, gener valid, rfc 5280 conformant, serial number exercis left user. enforc 20 octet length requirement, look like _a lot_ user entir know go gener valid serial number (in particular peopl know 20 octet maximum, awar serial 20 octet long cannot msb set.)
sinc ambigu best this, would seem prudent provid function gener serial (or method `*certificate`) conform 5280 rules, i.e.
* `func generateserial(rand io.reader) (*big.int, error)`
* `func (*certificate) generateserial(rand io.reader) error`
chang mention issue: `crypto/x509: revert serial length restriction`
