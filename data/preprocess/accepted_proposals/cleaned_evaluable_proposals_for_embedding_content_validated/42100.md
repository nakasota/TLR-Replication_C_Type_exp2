build: add ios/amd64 goos/goarch
part ad maco arm64 port, reclaim darwin/arm64 maco ad new ios/arm64 goos/goarch ios. however, left io emul amd64 lurch: continu use darwin/amd64 goos/goarch, plu "ios" build tag. seem quit inconsistent, propos ad ios/amd64 goos/goarch emulator.
sens new port (or least renam exist one), seem prudent run propos process. obvious come freeze, expect controversial, think land releas ios/arm64. @eliasnaur alreadi (quit simple) implement ready: cl 263798.

possibl add builder run io emulator?
per port policy, port must builder design maintainer. (we'v run issu past regress otherwise-unsupport emulators, particularli qemu user mode.)

suppos maco builder could repurpos start simul run ios/amd64 tests. cl 255257 support run go program test simulator, inclin set maintain builder. even did, would like make time freeze.

austin allud above, technic new port. use goos=darwin goarch=amd64 -tags=io happen work io simul never seen bug support gomobil gio projects. seem ios/arm64 darwin/amd64 builder provid enough coverage.
interest sole move alreadi exist simul support new (in go 1.16) goos=ios, leav awkward goos=darwin -tags=io configuration.
right. ideal would builder this, know port polici realli appli someth alreadi kind support. propos realli keep thing alreadi kind support consist changes.
guess part say is: configur “alreadi kind support”, need builder (regardless whether `goos=ios` `goos=darwin -tags=ios`) ensur configur regress.
(note distinguish “a configur _we support_” “a configur happen work today”.)
android, goos=android "linux" impli build tag.
suggest here? goos=io "darwin" impli build tag?
@rsc goos=io alreadi impli "darwin", like goos=android impli "linux". issu make io binari built io simul amd64 architectur use goos=io goarch=amd64 configuration, rather (goos=darwin goarch=amd64 -tags=ios).
post question relev (and probabl would'v better post issu instead).
"goos=darwin goarch=amd64 -tags=ios" configur ad 2015, much attent paid port polici today. done singl commit (see cl 12301) resolv issu #11736.
understand propos offer level support goos=io goarch=amd64 goos=darwin goarch=amd64 -tags=ios.
also cc @golang/release.
sorry, miss **amd64** import bit here, **ios**. clear yes.
accepted.
