cmd/go: add 'go gener -skip'
current `-run` flag, believ current imposs suppli regular express would allow _excluding_ certain express (due lookahead go' regex syntax). abl exclud express would use want exclud certain direct time-consum need moment, want run larg amount directives, would impract simpli run `go generate` multipl time differ `-run` flags.
think one way implement could addit flag. similar `grep`' `--invert-match` flag, could someth like:
```
go generate -invertmatch -run="my excluded pattern" ./...
``` 
alternatively, could also differ flag use instead `-run`, like:
```
go generate -runexcept="my excluded pattern" ./...
```
here, suppli `-runexcept` `-run` would invalid.
sure anyth here, did, appli -run flag too.
#41583 accept propos `go test -skip` flag sound similar. bring `go generate`?
