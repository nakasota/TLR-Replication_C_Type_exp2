cmd/go: add `go work use` command
propos amend go workspac propos (#45713) origin suggest @jayconrod comment issue:
> like way add modul subtre workspac use wildcards. specifically, like `go workspac add ./...`.
> * `go workspac use` would better subcommand name end use `go.work`.
> * think would help build familiar environ folk use work relat project `gopath`. could put `go.work` file `$gopath/src`, one vscode window projects.
> * talk support wildcard `go mod initwork` `go mod editwork`, break parallel `go mod init`, creat empti `go.mod` file, `go mod edit`, perform low-level syntact edit without extra processing.
propos would add new `go` command subcommand, perhap call `go mod addwork` (if #48256 accepted, new subcommand would call `go work add` `go work use`).
would ensur go.work command contain modul denot given pattern, remov match pattern longer exist disk.

would correspond command remov modul workspace? (that could use for, say, scripting.)
modul still remov `go mod editwork`, `go mod addwork` remov modul match pattern exist disk.

@hyangah ad list next meeting, thanks. sure miss one.
consult @jayconrod @rsc @bcmills, want renam propos command `go work use` (or `go mod usework` #48256 accepted). along renam command, renam `directory` `use`. `go work use` would add singl directori set directori state command line `go work use -r` would search subdirectori recurs add modul find (or remov modul go.work file contain directori longer exist).
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.
