=== Fetching Proposal: MDU6SXNzdWU2NTkyMzM4MTQ= ===
Issue URL: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40270

==== [Issue Title] ====
add "umbrella" label for issues about issues

==== [Issue Body] ====
There are a number of long-running issues that serve as tracking or meta issues for broad bugs or features. These are useful to subscribe to since they have a lower volume of updates than the detail issues and also serve as a reference for the current state of development.

I propose to add a "meta-issue" label for these issues to assist finding them.

This is prompted by my recent discovery of the Go2 review meta issue which is closing after a year's operation. I follow the proposal meta issue and find it very informative. I wish I'd known about the Go2 review issue too.

Examples of issues that could use this label:

- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33502
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33892
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6853
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37819
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22956
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37819
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37810
- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/12750

==== [Comments] ====

--- Comment #1 by ianlancetaylor ---
(Just to be clear, the Go 2 meta issue is not closing, just changing how it works.  Nothing against this proposal, which seems fine to me.)

--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
Adding to minutes. We can probably bikeshed the name for quite a long time and I'd rather not.
Is there any standard name used by lots of other projects for this?


--- Comment #3 by rsc ---
No one has commented about the name. Discussed more at proposal meeting and are suggesting "umbrella". 
Or we could take a leap and do "☂️".


--- Comment #4 by iand ---
I think umbrella is a good, generic term that covers the concept nicely.

--- Comment #5 by rsc ---
Based on the (limited) discussion and the fact that this decision is easily changed later (unlike most proposals), this seems like a **likely accept**.


--- Comment #6 by iand ---
Another candidate for this label: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24661

--- Comment #7 by rsc ---
No change in consensus, so accepted.


--- Comment #8 by rsc ---
Created label; if someone wants to apply it to the relevant issues and then close this one, please do.


--- Comment #9 by dmitshur ---
I've added the label to a few open issues where it seemed fitting. We can keep doing that in the future. Closing since this is done.
