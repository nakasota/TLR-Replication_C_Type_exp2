==== [Issue Title] ====
unicode/utf16: add RuneLen

==== [Issue Body] ====
Sometimes it's useful to determine how many 16-bit words it'll take to encode a unicode rune with UTF16. We already have `utf8.RuneLen`, and one for utf16 could be useful.

It would look something like this (those are private constants inside of utf16):

```golang
// RuneLen returns the number of 16-bit words required to encode the rune.
// It returns -1 if the rune is not a valid value to encode in UTF-16.
func RuneLen(r rune) int {
	switch {
	case 0 <= r && r < surr1, surr3 <= r && r < surrSelf:
		return 1
	case surrSelf <= r && r <= maxRune:
		return 2
	default:
		return -1
	}
}
```

I don't see `utf8.EncodedLen`.  Do you mean `EncodedLen` or `RuneLen`?  We do have `utf8.RuneLen`.

Woops yes, I meant RuneLen. Fixed.
