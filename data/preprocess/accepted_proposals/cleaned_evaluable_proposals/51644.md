==== [Issue Title] ====
encoding/binary: add AppendUvarint and AppendVarint

==== [Issue Body] ====
<!--
Our proposal process is documented here:
https://go.dev/s/proposal-process
-->
#50601 introduced AppendByteOrder, so it would be nice if we had
```go
func AppendUvarint(buf []byte, x uint64) []byte
func AppendVarint(buf []byte, x int64) []byte
```

Seems OK and it would match not just binary.LittleEndian.AppendUint32 but also things like strconv.AppendQuote.
