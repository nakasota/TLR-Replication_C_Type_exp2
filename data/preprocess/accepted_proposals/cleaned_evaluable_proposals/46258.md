==== [Issue Title] ====
syscall: add Pdeathsig to SysProcAttr for FreeBSD

==== [Issue Body] ====
This request is to add support for Pdeathsig on FreeBSD. 

FreeBSD supports requesting a signal when the parent process dies upwards from version 11.2 according to the manpages of procctl via the procctl  cmd `PROC_PDEATHSIG_CTL` and querying the current configured signal via `PROC_PDEATHSIG_STATUS`

Just a note that on Linux `SysProcAttr` has a `Pdeathsig` field that I assume would act the same way.
