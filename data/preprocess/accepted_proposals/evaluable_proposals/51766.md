net/netip: add IPv6LinkLocalAllRouters

==== [Issue Body] ====
<!--
Our proposal process is documented here:
https://go.dev/s/proposal-process
-->

I'm working on porting some of my networking packages to Go 1.18's `net/netip`, but it seems that I had forgotten about my uses of `net.IPv6linklocalallrouters` when I was making regular additions to inet.af/netaddr.

I'd like to suggest adding exactly the following to `net/netip`, akin to what already exists as `netip.IPv6LinkLocalAllNodes`:

```go
// IPv6LinkLocalAllRouters returns the IPv6 link-local all routers multicast
// address ff02::2.
func IPv6LinkLocalAllRouters() Addr { return AddrFrom16([16]byte{0: 0xff, 1: 0x02, 15: 0x02}) }
```

Along with link-local all nodes, this is one of the most fundamental IPv6 multicast group addresses. Package `net` exposes it today as a variable: https://pkg.go.dev/net#pkg-variables

Thanks!

Out of curiosity, why a func rather than a var?

I don't know the original motivation for this, but that's how all the other "constants" are implemented in netip as well:
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c6244b59095a74b77c977d250708ba1858ae2388/src/net/netip/netip.go#L74-L82

For consistency's sake it would make sense to stick to this design.

I seem to remember some discussion around avoiding package level allocation and that these calls would be inlined anyway. The immutability is an added bonus.
