==== [Issue Title] ====
reflect: add Pointer

==== [Issue Body] ====
Per chat elsewhere, reflect.Ptr is weird and doesn't match reflect.UnsafePointer or unsafe.Pointer.

Proposal: add reflect.Pointer matching reflect.Ptr.

Likewise reflect.PtrTo -> reflect.PointerTo probably.

Change https://golang.org/cl/341333 mentions this issue: `refect: rename Ptr Kind to Pointer (but keep Ptr)`

--- Comment #2 by rsc ---
Seems reasonable to me.


--- Comment #3 by robpike ---
So you just want Pointer to point to Ptr?

--- Comment #4 by bradfitz ---
@robpike, actually @rsc pointed out that he wanted it the other way: Ptr to point to Pointer. 😄 

--- Comment #5 by earthboundkid ---
FWIW, I was writing some reflect code a month or two back and had trouble remembering if I wanted Ptr or Pointer.
