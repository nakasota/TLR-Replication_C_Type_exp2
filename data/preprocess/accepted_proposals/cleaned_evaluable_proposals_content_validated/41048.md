==== [Issue Title] ====
net/http: add Transport.GetProxyConnectHeader

==== [Issue Body] ====
net/http.Transport currently has:

https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Transport.ProxyConnectHeader
```go
    // ProxyConnectHeader optionally specifies headers to send to
    // proxies during CONNECT requests.
    ProxyConnectHeader Header // Go 1.8
```

... but it's static for the life of the Transport.

Some authentication modes like NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate require a dynamic header value, which currently requires making a new Transport for each request going through a proxy. That's heavy, as the Transport is the unit of connection reuse.

Proposal:

```go
    // GetProxyConnectHeader is called to return headers to send to
    // proxuURL during a CONNECT request to the target ip:port. If it returns an error, the Transport
    // RoundTrip fails with that error. It can return (nil, nil) to not add headers.
    // If GetProxyConnectHeader is non-nil, ProxyConnectHeader is ignored.
    GetProxyConnectHeader func(ctx context.Context, proxyURL *url.URL, target string) (Header, error)

    // ProxyConnectHeader optionally specifies headers to send to
    // proxies during CONNECT requests. For dynamic use, see GetProxyConnectHeader.
    ProxyConnectHeader Header // Go 1.8
```

Potential implementation: https://github.com/tailscale/go/commit/6db68254af1050fa905957554cbd1df857a6f622 (licensed+CLA'd for use by Go)

(Lacking tests for now.)

The Get is a bit non-standard but it does follow our pattern of having `GetFoo func() T` override `Foo T` in a struct when we realize too late that `Foo T` might not be initializable from the start. (For example, Request.GetBody vs Request.Body.)

Does anyone object to this?

Based on the discussion above, this seems like a **likely accept**.
