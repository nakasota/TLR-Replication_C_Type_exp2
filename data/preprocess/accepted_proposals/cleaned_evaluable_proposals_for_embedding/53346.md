encoding/xml: add (*encoder).close() check unclos element
use [(*xml.encoder).encodetoken](
`encoder` check mismatch elements. is, return error e.g. `` element close `</b>` token extra `</c>` token element alreadi closed.
however, user simpli forget close elements, `encoder` emit incorrect xml without report error. see code, example. currently, user must track token encod themselves, make sure emit xml valid.
`flush` return `error`, possibl encod token `flush` called, can't complain unclos element itself.
thu propos add new method `encoder`:
```go
// Close the Encoder, indicating that no more data will be written. It flushes any buffered XML to the underlying writer
// and returns an error if the written XML is invalid (e.g. by containing unclosed elements).
// After Close has been called, any Encode method return errors.
func (enc *Encoder) Close() error
```
name method `close` indic call return error check user.
