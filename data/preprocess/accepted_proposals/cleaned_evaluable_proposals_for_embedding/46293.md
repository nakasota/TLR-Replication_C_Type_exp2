reflect: add mapiter.reset
currently, iter map requir two allocations: reflect.mapit runtime.hiter. embed runtime.hit (or rather, type shape size) reflect.mapiter, possibl elimin second allocation. could re-us reflect.mapit iter multipl maps, could elimin first alloc well.
propos add:
```go
// Reset changes iter to iterate over v.
// It panics if v's Kind is not Map and v is not the zero Value.
func (iter *MapIter) Reset(v Value)
```
allow v zero valu enabl caller avoid pin whatev map iter previous iter over.
note two would equivalent:
```go
iter := new(reflect.MapIter)
iter.Reset(mapVal)
```
```go
iter := mapVal.MapRange()
```

mean say "iterating" map instead?
@dsnet did. thanks, fixed.

anyon object proposal?
seem ok me.
think small issu call `reset` map differ type. constrain somewhat repres `hiter` insid compiler. thing currently, could exampl emb key valu instead pointer. reset differ type need realloc `hiter` tri avoid. hypothet even worst case mean reflect map iter would becom slow/allocatey again.
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.

chang consensus, **accepted**. 🎉
