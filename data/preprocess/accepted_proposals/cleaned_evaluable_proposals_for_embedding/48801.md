buffalo link test specif follow 2006-02-01 line check 2017-01-10 pars octob 1st. couchbas code look code gener databas entries, surpris deliber choos us date format. code first page search explicitli use us format:

past run yyyy-dd-mm mm-dd-yyyy deal govern form (which highli confusing, personally).
