testing: print precis benchmark time
user suppli high `testing.count` parameter, want look statist addit long stream number output.
poc code avail along sampl output.
main reason insid `go test` `prettyprint` output caus loss precis tool comput statist base output.
poc comput `mean` `95% confid interval` benchmark count higher `5`. believ reason default propos make configurable.
propos accept complet poc code reason fast.
look reaeson need part `go test` directly?
reason outlin proposal.
main reason insid go test prettyprint output caus loss precis tool comput statist base output.
everybodi happi loss, fine propos rejected.
sorry, miss bit text. found real scenario loss precis real caus problems? use benchmark scale nanosecond multipl seconds, never realli bother precision. varianc usual problem, least seen.
think caus problems. like loos precision.
clarifi find keep local patch gener userbas satisfi current state.
go test busi statist analysis.
mani analys might want numbers.
benchstat one set; keep outsid go test mean write easily.
problem go test print enough signific figur write analysi tool, let' talk instead.
sound like want see least four signific digit instead three,
instead 12.3 ns/op print, say, 12.35 ns/op. skeptic 0.05 ns/op accuraci behind it, also object ad digit small number show important.
/cc @aclement
could paraphrase, origin propos "move statist calcul go command, accur number prints".
shift propos "print accur numbers", implement print extra digit precis tini ns/op values, extern tool still written whatev statist need - go get go command.
would ("print accur numbers") address problem see @voronaam?
yes, think would better solution. agre get everyth extern tool may perform test data straight go' main test packag may good idea.
instead would nice enabl extern tool access enough precision.
thank you.
base discussion, sound like "print precis benchmark timings" (instead move stat packag testing) **like accept**.
leav open week final comments.
chang consensu (and check @aclement offline), **accepted**.
chang mention issue: `testing: print extra precis benchmark output`
chang mention issue: `testing: increas benchmark output four signific figures`
