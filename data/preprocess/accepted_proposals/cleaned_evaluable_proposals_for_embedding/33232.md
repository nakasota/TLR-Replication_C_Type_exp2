spec: allow 'any' 'interface{}' non-constraint context
**note, 2021-09-02**: `any` _is_ alia `interface{}`, special case use type paramet constraints. propos remov special case, allow any, well, anywhere.
cl show would look like use throughout go tree.

would lilk abl declar type keyword instead empti interface, like rune mean alia int32.
featur make languag readabl , without pollut declar mani empti interfaces. imho keyword perfect alias.
often use type alia much extra work:
```go
type any = interface{}
```
agre sentiment `interface{}` terribl readability, realli hope go 2 good enough gener make nearli use `interface{}` avoid anti-pattern. happens, `any` type probabl warrant all. reason gener complet fall through, sure, support builtin `any` alias. agre would increas readability.
support proposal, though strongly.
earli day use go, often encount `map[string]interface{}` type, realli confus new gopher. use year without know exactli means.
support propos too.
simpl implement readabl becom better
support proposal. power go mani thing there' singl way things. languag get bloat easili start ad addit syntax peopl prefer one other.
peopl new languag may initi learn 'any' keyword, read exist code, still look interface{} keyword. effectively, burden learn languag increases, rather decreases.
ye w/ @freeaqingm said, also must take care creat differ way thing because:
1. make tool difficult: go tool support new path thing, like user said tool expect output match chosen flavor alias.
2. reduc token space futur golang iterations. consid altern use `any` token futur iter language. lose option clear express choos alia `any` someth alreadi provided. random idea `any` could someth else: could refer `any` length array (`[any]string`) , could refer non zerovalu element slice ( `ani myslice`) like lodash' compact function .
exampl unimportant, point clear. choos make `any` stuck quit time, like good.
besid readabl reason, less verbos weird (esp. new gophers) anoth good point proposal.
@freeaqingm
began use go use go templat serv web pages, need understand `interface{}` is. need know assign vale it. `any` far better purpose.
gopher later suddenli realiz `any` `interface{}`, `viva` moment, fact help gopher understand go better.

`any` alia `interface{}`, mani alias go. tool can't handl cases, qualifi tool.

qualifi tool do.

builtin identifi keywords, user shadow needed.

realli believ interface{} bad, suggest extend propos deprec interface{} eventu remov it. fan either, primari argument two keyword essenti thing. argument would moot interface{} keyword removed.

still 'whatever' 'anythingreally' altern :yum:
anyon cloud explain histor reason interface{} design interface{} rather anyth else?
@freeaqingm
`any` keyword, builtin identifier, like, `rune` `byte`, etc.
`interface{}` mean interfac type specifi methods, happen make act `any` type. `interface{}` bad thing generally, use `any` type bad new gophers. confus mani new gophers.

@changkun

special design, logic consequ go' type declar syntax.
use anonym interfac zero methods:
```
func f(a interface{Foo(); Bar()}) {
    a.Foo()
    a.Bar()
}
```
analog use anonym struct anywher type expected:
```
func f(a struct{Foo int; Bar string}) {
    fmt.Println(a.Foo)
    fmt.Println(a.Bar)
}
```
empti interfac happen match type type least zero methods. remov interface{} would mean remov interfac function languag want stay consist / want introduc special case.
@fzipp good point. realiz post earlier comment well. make zero sens remov that.
stick origin reply; simpli explain interface{} interface{} works. there' need add addit keyword basic is/do thing.

> realli believ interface{} bad, suggest extend propos deprec interface{} eventu remov it. fan either, primari argument two keyword essenti thing. argument would moot interface{} keyword removed.
built type alia work like
```go
type byte = uint8
```
everi go packag earli days.
propos support way, well known fact.
haskel write guards:
```haskell
abs n
  | n < 0     = -n
  | otherwise =  n
```

```haskell
otherwise = True
```
imagin much less readabl one use `true` place `otherwise`.
good there' singl good way things.
abl add gener language, suspect mani fewer case peopl write `interface{}`, alia would correspondingli less value. put hold pend decis generics.
valu act like top type type system may useful sometim even generics.
say higher order function compos logs. need contract anyth like type want log argument perform action. someth like (take pseudocode):
```
func add(a interface{}, b interface{}, action fn_type<args>){
  return fn(a, b) -> {
    fmt.Printf("%v %v", a, b)
    action(a, b)    
  }
}
```
top type would good case instead write ```interface{}``` either way, think propos still value.
relevant:
also relevant:
latest gener design, find following:
> however, it‘ tediou write interface{} everi time write gener function doesn’t impos constraint type parameters. design suggest type constraint equival interface{}. predeclar name, implicitli declar univers block. valid use anyth type constraint.
> (note: clearli could make gener avail alia interface{}, new defin type defin interface{}. however, want design draft, generics, lead possibl signific chang non-gener code. ad gener purpos name interface{} discuss separately).
think "it valid use anyth type constraint." bad idea. far simpl consist allow use alia `type = interface{}` everywhere, hope gener introduced, see get use less less non-gener code.
feel strongli `any` either allow type paramet everywher else, allow nowher all. quit strongli allowed.
confusing-to-beginn pattern use `interface{}` neg
`any` mean thing sometim allow add confus thu significantli wors
thing must make confusing. ad `any` would nice improvement, condit
disagre too. mayb dart, typescript, rust, etc. good improvement, otherwis go, put packag simpl file like
`extra.go`
``` go
package something
type any = interface{}
type null = struct{} // for channels f.e.
// something that you want to syntax sugaring
```
could amaz practice! mean, `any/null` good, readable, `interface{}/struct{}`, implement now, specif case want.

design proposal:

understand correctly, would result "alias" **only** type paramet constrain (and nowher else). imo would make languag consistent.
believ would wise either renam `any` `interface{}`, simpli deprec `interface{}`, two type mean thing would put lot confus ambigu new adopt go future.

@g13013 two types. one name (an identifier), actual thing. like confus `fmt.stringer` `interface{string() string}` exist time.
@fzipp think actual `any` mean `interface{}`, wrong ?
@g13013 yes, `any` identifi `interface{}`, like `fmt.stringer` identifi `interface{string() string}`.
`any` alia `interface{}` might call identifier, still thing, point is, two thing mean thing avoided.
@g13013
complain two way write fmt.stringer?
write `func f( fmt.stringer) {}` write `func f( interface{string() string}) {}`
complain two way write io.writer?
write `func f(w io.writer) {}` write `func f(w interface{write(p []byte) (n int, err error)}) {}`
suddenli problem `any` `interface{}`?
@fzipp so, use `json.unmarshal` without `interface{}`/`any`?
`any` could alias) agree, problem could solv without chang languag specif
@fzipp would complain `func f( interface{string() string}) {}` `func f(interface{write(p []byte) (n int, err error)}`, would definit ban team make code unnecessarili unreadable.
`interface{}` anoth story, de facto standard go accept type, think got wrong, go team chose introduc `any` generics, deprec happen document guid languag itself, will keep `interface{}`, would definit prefer write gener `interface{}` instead `any`.
