bufio: use underli readfrom even data buffer
`(*bufio.writer).readfrom` use underli writer' `readfrom` method present, `bufio.writer` data buffered.
`http` packag write request, first write header `bufio.writer` use `io.copy` write request body. buffer header prevent use underli `net.conn`' `readfrom`. flush header bodi may result unnecessari addit write, possibl split small request across multipl packets.
similar problem may occur case `bufio.writer` amount data written it, follow larg copy.
`readfrom` instead fill current buffer, flush it, continu oper underli writer' `readfrom` (when present).
```go 
// ReadFrom implements io.ReaderFrom. This calls the underlying writer's ReadFrom method,
// if any. If b has buffered data, this fills the buffer before calling the underlying `ReadFrom`.
func (b *Writer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error) {
   ...
}
```
seem like complet reason optimization.
might find surprise, course, see anyth wrong priori.
