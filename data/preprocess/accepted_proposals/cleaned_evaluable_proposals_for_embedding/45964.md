all: requir linux kernel version 2.6.32
last version 2.6.23(.17) releas februari 2008 src.
current cento lt (v7) use kernel 3.10 src.
debian' minimum 3.16 src).
quick search show lot random issu could avoid support slightli newer kernel.
request bump minimum requir kernel version least 3.10.
support change. goo variant fairli regularli drop support older versions, linux 2.x upstream support sinc 2016 (2.6.32 got extend ubuntu/rhel, 2.x version went eol 2012). support dozen linux version add cost mainten code complexity, make test difficult, etc.
worth note debian stretch, "oldstable", long-term support mid-2022, linux 3.16 like say. actual stabl releas linux 4.19, support upstream 2024.
similarly, cento v7 use linux 3.10 support 2024. seem like could consid anoth bump sometim after.
glibc also requir least 3.2 version sinc 2.27 (announcement) architectures, includ x86 ones.
issu imagin moment old kernel use openvz vpses, start becom problem newer debian version already.
one current run "2.6.32-042stab134.7" debian stretch work (use glibc 2.24), howev updat jessi possibl due use glibc 2.28.
non-x86 architectur issue, also possibl reason (or least part of) glibc delay requir 3.2 kernel x86 architectur (they requir 3.2 kernel 2.25 version architectures).

glibc requir 3.2. cento appar requir 3.10.
think chang minimum to?
benefit bump minimum?
link top comment search [kernel 2.6.23] issu tracker.
bug 2.6.23 kernels.
code abl delete, like drop xp?
would make go binari crash startup run old kernel?
still tri understand change, specif
exact detail (which version? take time check kernel version crash startup old kernels?)
benefit (which code simplifi deleted?).
thoughts?
give opinion questions, author proposal.
> version?
think chang minimum 3.10 would sensible, given linux distro info given above. see clear reason go lower that; even glibc still support 3.2 today, kernel version went eol 2018 use support linux distro find.
> take time check kernel version crash startup old kernel
check right current minimum, right? new minimum differ exist minimum, given choos conservative?
> code simplifi deleted?
me, one main benefit testing. assum want goos=linux builder run oldest version kernel support, confid actual work advertised. that' lot harder version eol, use maintain distro.
even one want goos=linux builder multipl major version linux (mayb popular lt versions), bump minimum would hope mean fewer version worri about.
ask summari code could simplified, issu could closed, seem reasonable. experienc area, five minut grep found five like candidates:





iant point timerfd ad 2.6.25 probabl want depend time.externalnow, bump least far. exampl show could bump least 2.6.28 simplifi code.
bradfitz point synolog 6.2 ship 2.6.32.
cento 6 (out support clearli still used) run 2.6.32 well.
mayb rais 2.6.32, let us elimin old things, keep exist known use case working, seem add known burden compar newer versions.
thought rais 2.6.32?
would clean check go runtim except one requir 4.5+, sound good!
bump fewer version certainli better bump none :) alway revisit newer linux version coupl years.

linux pro, synolog 6.2.4 na shows:
```
admin@NAS:~$ uname -a
Linux NAS 4.4.59+ #25556 SMP PREEMPT Thu Mar 4 18:03:46 CST 2021 x86_64 GNU/Linux synology_apollolake_218+
```
suggest seem target 3.10, 2.6.32 realli requirement?
know user go program built synolog 6.2 use 2.6.32, know user cento 6 use 2.6.32.
> suggest seem target 3.10, 2.6.32 realli requirement?
clear downsid 3.10 2.6.32 drop support systems, know real instanc go run today.
upsid 3.10 2.6.32?
retitl specifi 2.6.32. anyon object change?
