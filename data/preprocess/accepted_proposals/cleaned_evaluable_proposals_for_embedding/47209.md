path/filepath: add skipal
re-open sinc origin author close - seemingli percept interest. propos api small, issu six upvot reaction time closing, person think good idea too, reopen here.
sinc possibl delet github comment entir threads, made waybackmachin copi today:
summary: right `filepath.skipdir` skip entir directori walk via `filepath.walk`, noth stop walk entirely. possibl accomplish return custom error ignor `filepath.walk` error return, that' bit clunky. would nice simpli use `stopwalk`, `walk` return nil error stop way.
origin issu proposal, think complex controversi enough need process. also think wait select propos review might caus confus around lack interest.

sure, mention again.
upon closer inspection, look like repli thread origin author deleted, almost look like ian talk ourselves. affect propos api all, though, sinc talk issu gotten resolut yet.
@cherrymui particular reason turn proposal? particularli want avoid red tape wait propos review committe pick :)

stopwalk use skip prefix skipdir does, like skipall?
/cc @robpik
skipal consistent, stopwalk clear. either fine.
vote stopwalk
feel stopwalk better choice.
skipal impli still scans/read everything, callback, wherea stopwalk impli full stop.
balanc vote `skipall`. assum `skipdir` avoid scan directori contents, seem reason assum `skipall` scan all.
also:
- mean alway sit next error valu doc
- similar name impli kinship function (both sentinel valu interpret walk)
skipal is.
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.

chang consensus, **accepted**. 🎉
