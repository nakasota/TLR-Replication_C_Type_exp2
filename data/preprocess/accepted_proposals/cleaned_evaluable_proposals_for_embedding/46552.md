syscall: add syscalln
current go support call 18 argument call function window dll. sdk function 22 parameters. seem workaround issue.
idea stop?
syscal 21 parameters, probabl miss some. (with apolog alan perlis)
think msvc allow 256 paramet function definition, probabl need that.
> sdk function 22 parameters.
provid reference, please.
thank you.

exampl sdk led matrix display controller. one function is:
`int hdapi hd_rt_sendrealtimetext(int nsendtype, void *pstrparams, int nrealtimeareaindex, int nmaxpagecount, int ncolor, int ngray, int nx, int ny, int nwidth, int nheight, void *ptext, int ntextcolor, int nbackgroupcolor, int nstyle, void *pfontname, int nfontheight, int nshoweffect, int nshowspeed,int nstaytime, int nlivetime, int bsavetoflash, void *pdeviceguid);`
go sufficient, sinc 24 highest number.
theoretical. sdk controllers:

can't find it, publicli available.
alreadi use anoth languag sdk, big problem me.
tri add syscall24 think chang `asmcgocall` function too.

could add variad function done, even ntv6 extend max syscal list 640kb. alreadi support variad syscal proc.cal lazyproc.call.
**edit:** mean, support api, compil support unsafe.pointer-safety-rul magic requir make work. function turn current reli call syscallnn functions.
however, also look like syscallnn function eventu trampolin back common, variad cgo stub anyway. seem like fundament place already. need cleanup implementation, mayb expos extra primitive. (i know window user care directli issu syscall.syscall21, affect user indirectli via proc.call/lazyproc.call.)

agre jason sentiment, pretti rare.
sinc 24 highest number, syscall24 last api ever need. difficult add apis. also adjust runtime.testsyscall18 verifi change.
> could add variad function ...
ad syscall21 syscall24 easi compar ad implement new api. 1 syscall21 user far. invest much effort here.
altern say syscall21 syscall24. would loos user controllers.

alreadi trampolin back varidac sub, make primari api varadic, cut middl pieces. rework mksyscal codegen around direct varad route. syscallxx helper left around backward compat. would address concern proposal, also clean api considerably.
good point, write vararg version seem clearli preferable. signatur would presum someth like
syscalln(trap uintptr, arg ...uintptr) (r1, r2 uintptr, err errno)
think safe use `//go:uintptrescapes` annotation.
ok, sound like syscalln.
could limit windows, seem like implement systems.
non-window system clearer limit, handl n limit return error otherwise.
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.

chang consensus, **accepted**. 🎉
