time: add ticker.reset
<!-- pleas answer question submit issue. thanks! -->
### version go use (`go version`)?

go 1.12

### issu reproduc latest release?
yes.
### oper system processor architectur use (`go env`)?
linux amd64
### do?
ad api reset function.
### expect see?
hope propos take effect,becaus sometim need adjust time dynamically.
problem,thi suggestion.
pleas read following.thanks.
api:
// reset durat reset ticker.
func (t *ticker) reset(d duration) bool {
t.r.f == nil {
panic("time: reset call uniniti ticker")
}
w := when(d)
activ := stoptimer(&t.r)
t.r.when = w
t.r.period = int64(d)
starttimer(&t.r)
return activ
}
seem reason abl chang durat ticker.
return valu time.timer.reset mistak imposs use correctly, api would provid return value. seem like better option would return valu reset either:
1. requir ticker stopped; panic not.
2. ticker stopped, first stop drain exist valu channel.
second seem defens use code someth like:
:= time.newticker(d)
rang t.c {
... { t.reset(newd) }
}
general, reset happen separ channel receive, want t.stop, synchron receiv know expect new duration, t.reset. pattern need receiv reset caller same, seem like common.
would lean toward option 2. thoughts?
@rsc
agre reset return value,but know stoptim return error conditions,at first want separ two apis,lik this:
func newticker(d duration) *ticker {
...
//starttimer(&t.r)
return
}
func (t *ticker) startticker() {c
starttimer(&t.r)
}
way develop control startup time,lat ad api reset,us like this:
ticker := time.newticker(d)
go func() {
_ = rang ticker.c {
...
}
}()
...
...
...
... {
ticker.reset(newd)
}
situat stoptim return error,do better solution?
given two option mention above, seem like "the ticker stopped, first stop drain exist valu channel" much less error-pron api. want that, cours stop ticker first.
clarification, seem like **like accept**.
chang consensus, accepted.
