cmd/go: go version support non-execut go binari
`go version` command support execut files, restrict state documentation:
`go version report go version use build name execut files.`
restrict implement check `.exe` file extens window check file `0111` permissions.

propos `go version` also support non-execut binaries, binari compil use `buildmode=c-shared` `buildmode=c-archive`, binari also contain use version data.
see #45234 detail use-case.

straightforward fix `go version` subcommand, think fix (with accompani regress test). sure formal propos realli needed.
fix straightforward, think ultim fall much-need “`buildmode` cleanup” bucket, probabl long overdu also difficult prioritize.
build info stamp file built `c-archive` `c-shared` mode, `go version` attempt read it.
might simpl extend `go version -m` work file built `c-shared` mode. thing sure whether need appli reloc read inform binary. think sinc actual load binari memory.
`c-archive` littl harder: `go version -m` would need understand archiv format enough find execut within it.
note archiv read code cmd/link/internal/ld/ar.go.
toler extrem rare fals positives, may also cheaper easier pars file all. see e.g.
alreadi realli pars file, except find start data segment. sometim data segment far binary, use pars skip least right approxim place. suppos could read entir file that' go slower.
sound like probabl pretti easi it.
base discuss above, propos seem like **like accept**.
