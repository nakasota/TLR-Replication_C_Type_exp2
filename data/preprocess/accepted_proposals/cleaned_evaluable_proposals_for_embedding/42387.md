suggest add
packag fs
// fileinfotodirentri return direntri implement
// return inform fileinfo info.
func fileinfotodirentry(info fileinfo) direntri
name bit awkward found better one yet.
/cc @robpik
make fileinfo method would shorten name.
`fileinfo` interfac type, technic ad method break go 1 compat guarantee.
oh, forgot os.fileinfo type alia fs.fileinfo. thanks.
imagin come can't imagin come often belong standard library.
could certainli due lack imagin part. why/how come far?
@jimmyfrasch come time implement readdir fs implementation.
arbitrari file implement call stat it?
could add (possibl optional) method like stat file return direntry. real file system would need worri would handl standard library.
see anyon object this, realli come everi time tri implement new interfaces, seem like includ new interfaces.
seem like **like accept**. better name welcome.
chang consensus, accepted.
chang mention issue: `io/fs: implement fileinfotodirentry`
name kind long. would prefer `fs.fileinfodir(fileinfo)`
