### What did you do?

Called `AuthorizeOrder` to request a new ACMEv2 Order with identifiers rejected by the CA

### What did you expect to see?

An `acme.Error` populated with [RFC 8555 subproblems](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-6.7.1)

### What did you see instead?
An `acme.Error` with no subproblems available.

This limits the information clients can provide to users and prevents automated corrections to the invalid Order, such as by removing the the rejected identifiers and requesting a new Order.

--- Comment #3 by rolandshoemaker ---
Since this changes an API, marking it as a proposal.

CL 233165 proposes the following API addition/change:

```
type Subproblem struct {
	Type        string
	Detail      string
	Instance    string
	Identifier  *AuthzID
}

func (sp Subproblem) String() string

type Error struct {
	...
	Subproblems []Subproblem
}
```
