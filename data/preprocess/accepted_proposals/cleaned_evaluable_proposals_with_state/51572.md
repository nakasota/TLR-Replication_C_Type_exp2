==== [Issue Title] ====
cmd/go: add 'unix' build tag but not *_unix.go file support

==== [Issue Body] ====
In #20322 we accepted a proposal to recognize unix both as a file suffix and a build tag.
@ianlancetaylor implemented it but found that there were many collisions with files named `*_unix.go` that would break builds.

It sounds like we should revisit this and add just the build tag, leaving unix unrecognized in file names.
This would match what we already do with tags like gc, gccgo, cgo, and so on.

So that's the proposal: add unix only as a build tag.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20322#issuecomment-1057682650 and the following comments for more details.
(Opened a new issue so people don't have to read the entire conversation from before.)
