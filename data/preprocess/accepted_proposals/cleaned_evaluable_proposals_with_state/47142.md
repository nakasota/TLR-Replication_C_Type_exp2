==== [Issue Title] ====
database/sql: use errors.Is when checking for driver.ErrBadConn

==== [Issue Body] ====
As of Go1.17, retry logic and various other logic rely on the exact error value `driver.ErrBadConn` being returned if the connection is in a bad state. Various calls, such as the `IsValid` method may be called if supported on a driver that will prevent bad connections from poisoning the pool. However, right now, a driver still has to make a decision to return an interesting error or to get retry logic.

See https://github.com/denisenkom/go-mssqldb/issues/586

I propose that throughout `database/sql` we use `errors.Is` rather then a direct comparison to `driver.ErrBadConn`.

@rsc What would be the process for this to move forward?

This seems OK as long as we document it for driver authors. Adding to minutes.
