net/netip: add IPv6Loopback

==== [Issue Body] ====
We already have `net.IPv6loopback` today, but lack an equivalent in `net/netip`. I'd like to propose adding `netip.IPv6Loopback` specifically; IPv6 defines exactly one loopback address: `::1`. 

IPv4 assigns the entire `127.0.0.0/8` and thus should be out of scope for this proposal.

Concretely:

```go
// IPv6Loopback returns the IPv6 loopback address ::1.
func IPv6Loopback() Addr { return AddrFrom16([16]byte{15: 0x01}) }
```

See also #51766 for a similar addition and rationale. Thanks!
